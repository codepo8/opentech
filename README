=== Hot new web technologies and how to promote them ===

At this year's Mozilla All Hands one of the sessions was this one. Instead of
sharing slides in Keynote or Powerpoint format we decided to make this a
re-usable way of advocating technologies.

For starters, we set up a wiki page on Mozilla where we'll keep screencasts,
explanations and demos to pick and mix for your own presentations:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/Developer_Engagement/Grab_bag

This here, however is going further. It is an HTML5 presentation based on
DZSlides that allows you to pick and mix and show the final presentation at
the same time.

You can see it in action at:

Just uncheck the slides you want not to show, and hit the start presentation
button.
